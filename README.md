# A weather app using React + Typescript
For creating this SPA, [Create React App example with TypeScript](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app-with-typescript) is being used as a boiler plate along side with [MUI](https://mui.com/) for components and layout styling.
Multiple free APIs are being used as follow:
1. [graphql-weather-api.herokuapp](https://graphql-weather-api.herokuapp.com) in conjuction with Apollo clinet to retreive city's weather detail through Graphql.
2. [autocomplete.travelpayouts](https://autocomplete.travelpayouts.com) to fetch the list of autocomplete on search input.
3. [openweathermap](https://api.openweathermap.org) for fetching historical weather details and also retreive specific areas' weather located on map.
